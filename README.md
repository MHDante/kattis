# Kattis

Some of the problems I solved during the course "Problem Solving and Programming under Pressure" at KTH.

The directory names correspond to the problem ID on Kattis, i.e. https://open.kattis.com/problems/factovisors for problem "factovisors". Most problems are solved in Java due to time constraints on Kattis, the others are solved using Python 2.7.

# Execution

For Java:
```
javac Main.java && java Main < samples/<sample.in>
```

For Python:
```
python <problem>.py < samples/<sample.in>
```
